# P4

My P4 is a blog site made with React on Rails. I generated models with scaffolding in rails for more rapid prototyping. 

on load: all blogs are displayed from the database
clickables: 
+ button triggers a redirect to a new blog form.
- button deletes a blog.
/\ button edits any field in a blog.
